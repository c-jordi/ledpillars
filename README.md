# LED Pillars

## Motivation
The idea for this project was taken directly from [lightpillar.ch](https://lightpillar.ch/), who deserve all the credit for coming up with this wonderfully simple idea. After discovering the beauty of the result, we decided to try to recreate it ourselves, in order to learn about microcontrollers, led strips and the control of such systems. We have no intention to make money off of this project, it is purely for educational and entertainment purposes. Once we have a working prototype, we hope to produce a detailed guide to help others create and control their own led pillars. In the meantime, you can follow our progress in this repo.
